    <h1>What is a Device Driver?</h1>

    <p>
      A <b>device driver</b> is software that lies between the application and
      the device. These device drivers provide a uniform interface to interact
      with the hardware. In UNIX specifically, hardware devices are accessed
      through device files, hence the the common linux-ism,
      <q>everything is a file</q>.
    </p>

    <div class="code_example">
      <pre><code>
      int main(void) {
        int handle = open("/dev/fb0", O_RDONLY);
        if (handle == -1)
          perror("unable to open '/dev/fb0'");
      }
    </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>
      As seen above, the method in which you interact with a device file is the
      same as you would a normal file.
